<p class="blockquot1">
[In his admirably edited collection of poems of the civil war, entitled
“Bugle Echoes,” Mr. Francis F. Browne introduces this poem with the
following note:</p>

<p class="blockquot2">“There has been no little dispute as to the authorship
of this poem. The <i>Philadelphia Press</i>, in 1861, said it
was ‘written by a private in Company G, Stuart’s engineer
regiment, at Camp Lesley, near Washington.’ But it may now
be stated positively that it was written by a Confederate
soldier, still living. The poem is usually printed in a
very imperfect form, with the fourth, fifth, and sixth
stanzas omitted. The third line of the fifth stanza affords
internal evidence of Southern origin.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span>]</p>

<p class="f120"><span class="smcap">By JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.</span></p>

<p class="blockquot1 space-below3">
[This poem is a part of the second series of “The
Bigelow Papers,” a work wholly unmatched in the literature
of humor, that has an earnest purpose and well matured
thought for its sources of inspiration. The poem was called
forth by what is known as “the <i>Trent</i> affair.” Captain
Wilkes, commanding the United States man-of-war, <i>San
Jacinto</i>, boarded the British mail steamer <i>Trent</i> on the
8th of November, 1861, and took from her the Confederate
commissioners Mason and Slidell. Great Britain resented
the act, and for a time there was serious apprehension of
war between that country and the United States; but as the
seizure of the commissioners on board a neutral vessel was
deemed to be an act in violation of international law, the
Government at Washington, after inquiry into the facts,
surrendered the prisoners. The version of the poem here
given is a correct one, taken from the collected edition
of Mr. Lowell’s poems. An abridged and otherwise imperfect
version is given in many collections.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span>]</p>

<span class="i6">For nothing now remained</span>
<span class="i0">On the wrecked and sinking <i>Cumberland</i></span>
<span class="i2">But to save the flag unstained.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he swore an oath in the sight of heaven</span>
<span class="i2">(If he kept it, the world can tell):</span>
<span class="i0">“Before I strike to a rebel flag,</span>
<span class="i2">I’ll sink to the gates of hell!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Here, take my sword; ’tis in my way;</span>
<span class="i2">I shall trip o’er the useless steel:</span>
<span class="i0">For I’ll meet the lot that falls to all,</span>
<span class="i2">With my shoulder at the wheel.”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the little negro took the sword,</span>
<span class="i2">And oh! with what reverent care!</span>
<span class="i0">Following his master step by step,</span>
<span class="i2">He bore it here and there.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A thought had crept through his sluggish brain,</span>
<span class="i2">And shone in his dusky face,</span>
<span class="i0">That somehow&mdash;he could not tell just how&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">’Twas the sword of his trampled race.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And as Morris, great with his lion heart,</span>
<span class="i2">Rushed onward from gun to gun,</span>
<span class="i0">The little negro slid after him,</span>
<span class="i2">Like a shadow in the sun.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But something of pomp and of curious pride</span>
<span class="i2">The sable creature wore,</span>
<span class="i0">Which at any time but a time like that</span>
<span class="i2">Would have made the ship’s crew roar.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Over the wounded, dying, and dead,</span>
<span class="i2">Like an usher of the rod,</span>
<span class="i0">The black page, full of his mighty trust,</span>
<span class="i2">With dainty caution trod.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No heed he gave to the flying ball,</span>
<span class="i2">No heed to the bursting shell;</span>
<span class="i0">His duty was something more than life,</span>
<span class="i2">And he strove to do it well.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Down, with our starry flag apeak,</span>
<span class="i2">In the whirling sea we sank;</span>
<span class="i0">And captain and crew and the sword-bearer</span>
<span class="i2">Were washed from the bloody plank.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They picked us up from the hungry waves&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">Alas! not all. And where,</span>
<span class="i0">Where is the faithful negro lad?</span>
<span class="i2">“Back oars! avast! look there!”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We looked, and as heaven may save my soul,</span>
<span class="i2">I pledge you a sailor’s word,</span>
<span class="i0">There, fathoms deep in the sea he lay,</span>
<span class="i2">Still grasping his master’s sword.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We drew him out; and many an hour</span>
<span class="i2">We wrought with his rigid form,</span>
<span class="i0">Ere the almost smothered spark of life</span>
<span class="i2">By slow degrees grew warm.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The first dull glance that his eyeballs rolled</span>
<span class="i2">Was down toward his shrunken hand;</span>
<span class="i0">And he smiled, and closed his eyes again,</span>
<span class="i2">As they fell on the rescued brand.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And no one touched the sacred sword,</span>
<span class="i2">Till at length, when Morris came,</span>
<span class="i0">The little negro stretched it out,</span>
<span class="i2">With his eager eyes aflame.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And if Morris wrung the poor boy’s hand,</span>
<span class="i2">And his words seemed hard to speak,</span>
<span class="i0">And tears ran down his manly cheeks,</span>
<span class="i2">What tongue shall call him weak?</span>

these stanzas, but this is one of the best metrical protests that

<p class="f120"><span class="smcap">By BRET HARTE.</span></p>

<p class="blockquot2"> [A Union officer who was with the Eleventh
Corps in the battle of Gettysburg says: “During the first day’s fight,
an old man, in a swallow-tailed coat and battered cylinder hat, came
stalking across the fields from the town, and made his appearance at
Colonel Stone’s position. With a musket in his hand and ammunition in
his pocket, this venerable citizen asked Colonel Wister’s permission
to fight. Wister directed him to go over to the Iron Brigade, where
he would be sheltered by the woods; but the old man insisted on going
forward to the skirmish line. He was allowed to do so, and continued
firing until the skirmishers retired, when he was the last man to
leave. He afterwards fought with the Iron Brigade, where he was three
times wounded. This patriotic and heroic citizen was Constable John
Burns of Gettysburg.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Author’s note.</span>]</p>

</div>
<span class="i4a drop-cap">Have you heard the story that gossips tell</span>
<span class="i6">Of Burns of Gettysburg? No? Ah, well:</span>
<span class="i0">Brief is the glory that hero earns,</span>
<span class="i0">Briefer the story of poor John Burns;</span>
<span class="i0">He was the fellow who won renown&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The only man who didn’t back down</span>
<span class="i0">When the rebels rode through his native town;</span>
<span class="i0">But held his own in the fight next day,</span>
<span class="i0">When all his townsfolk ran away.</span>
<span class="i0">That was in July, sixty-three,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The very day that General Lee,</span>
<span class="i0">Flower of Southern chivalry,</span>
<span class="i0">Baffled and beaten, backward reeled</span>
<span class="i0">From a stubborn Meade and a barren field.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I might tell how, but the day before,</span>
<span class="i0">John Burns stood at his cottage-door,</span>
<span class="i0">Looking down the village street,</span>
<span class="i0">Where, in the shade of his peaceful vine,</span>
<span class="i0">He heard the low of his gathered kine,</span>
<span class="i0">And felt their breath with incense sweet;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Or, I might say, when the sunset burned</span>
<span class="i0">The old farm gable, he thought it turned</span>
<span class="i0">The milk that fell like a babbling flood</span>
<span class="i0">Into the milk-pail, red as blood;</span>
<span class="i0">Or, how he fancied the hum of bees</span>
<span class="i0">Were bullets buzzing among the trees.</span>
<span class="i0">But all such fanciful thoughts as these</span>
<span class="i0">Were strange to a practical man like Burns,</span>
<span class="i0">Who minded only his own concerns,</span>
<span class="i0">Troubled no more by fancies fine</span>
<span class="i0">Than one of his calm-eyed, long-tailed kine,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Quite old-fashioned and matter-of-fact,</span>
<span class="i0">Slow to argue, but quick to act.</span>
<span class="i0">That was the reason, as some folk say,</span>
<span class="i0">He fought so well on that terrible day.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And it was terrible. On the right</span>
<span class="i0">Raged for hours the heady fight,</span>

<span class="i0">Undulate like the living waves</span>
<span class="i0">That all the day unceasing swept</span>
<span class="i0">Up to the pits the rebels kept&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Round-shot ploughed the upland glades,</span>
<span class="i0">Sown with bullets, reaped with blades;</span>
<span class="i0">Shattered fences here and there,</span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The very trees were stripped and bare;</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Just where the tide of battle turns,</span>

<span class="i0">Was a bright-blue coat with a rolling collar,</span>
<span class="i0">And large gilt buttons&mdash;size of a dollar,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">With tails that the country-folk called “swaller.”</span>
<span class="i0">He wore a broad-brimmed, bell-crowned hat,</span>
<span class="i0">White as the locks on which it sat.</span>
<span class="i0">Never had such a sight been seen</span>
<span class="i0">For forty years on the village green,</span>
<span class="i0">Since old John Burns was a country beau,</span>
<span class="i0">And went to the “quiltings” long ago.</span>

<span class="i0">“How are you, White Hat?” “Put her through!”</span>

<span class="i0">And what was the value he set on those;</span>
<span class="i0">While Burns, unmindful of jeer and scoff,</span>
<span class="i0">Stood there picking the rebels off&mdash;</span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And his corded throat, and the lurking frown</span>
<span class="i0">Of his eyebrows under his old bell-crown;</span>
<span class="i0">Until, as they gazed, there crept an awe</span>
<span class="i0">Through the ranks in whispers, and some men saw,</span>
<span class="i0">In the antique vestments and long white hair,</span>
<span class="i0">The Past of the Nation in battle there;</span>
<span class="i0">And some of the soldiers since declare</span>
<span class="i0">That the gleam of his old white hat afar,</span>

<p class="f120"><span class="smcap">By JOHN R. THOMPSON.</span></p>

<p class="blockquot2"> [During the battles in the Wilderness at the
beginning of the campaign of 1864, General Robert E. Lee, impressed
with the desperate necessity of carrying a certain peculiarly difficult
position, seized the colors of a Texas regiment and undertook to
lead the perilous assault in person. The troops and their colonel
remonstrated with vehemence, the colonel, in his men’s behalf, pledging
the regiment to carry the position if General Lee would retire. The
troops advanced to the charge shouting “Lee to the Rear!” as a sort of
battle cry.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span>] </p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SHERMAN’S MARCH TO THE SEA.</h2>
<p class="f120"><span class="smcap">By SAMUEL H. M. BYERS.</span></p>

<p class="blockquot2"> [General Sherman, in a recent conversation with
the editor of this collection, declared that it was this poem with its
phrase, “march to the sea,” that threw a glamour of romance over the
campaign which it celebrates. Said General Sherman: “The thing was
nothing more or less than a change of base, an operation perfectly
familiar to every military man, but a poet got hold of it, gave it the
captivating label, ‘The March to the Sea,’ and the unmilitary public
made a romance out of it.” It may be remarked that the General’s
modesty overlooks the important fact that the romance lay really in
his own deed of derring-do; the poet merely recorded it, or at most
interpreted it to the popular intelligence. The glory of the great
campaign was Sherman’s and his army’s; the joy of celebrating it was
the poet’s; the admiring memory of it is the people’s.&mdash;<span

<p class="blockquot2 space-below3"> [This poem appeared very soon after the
surrender of the Confederate armies, and was probably the first, as
it is the finest, poetical expression of reverent regret for the Lost
Cause, without any touch of bitterness in its loss. The author was a
Catholic priest, who wrote a number of poems of merit, though none
that appealed so strongly as this one does to the generous sympathy of
the victor with the sorrow of the vanquished. The author was born in
Norfolk, Va., August 15, 1839, and died in Louisville, Ky., April 22,
1886.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor</span>.] </p>

War worthier of celebration in verse, or more to be honored in the
remembrance, than the organization and work of the United States
Sanitary Commission. When the conditions created by the stress of
the war became apparent, the compassion of kindly men and women in
the North was deeply stirred by the thought that there was suffering
among the soldiers which the government could not relieve, and that
there were wants which could not be supplied by military agencies.
The generous desire to minister to these wants and to relieve this
suffering was quickly organized into action with that business-like
sagacity which distinguishes the American character. The Sanitary
Commission was formed as the agent and almoner of the popular
generosity. It was supported entirely by voluntary contributions.
It was as thoroughly organized as the army commissariat itself, and
wherever there was a comfort needed, or a wounded or sick man to
be cared for, its supply wagons, its appliances, and its trained
nurses were found. The affectionate gratitude of the troops toward
the beneficent association is reflected in this poem.&mdash;<span

<h2 class="nobreak">WHEN THIS CRUEL WAR IS OVER.</h2>

<p class="blockquot2"> [There is nothing in this
sentimental song that enables one to read the riddle of its remarkable
popularity during the Civil War. It has no poetic merit; its rhythm is
commonplace, and the tune to which it was sung was of the flimsiest
musical structure, without even a trick of melody to commend it. Yet
the song was more frequently sung, on both sides, than any other, the
Southern soldiers inserting “gray” for “blue” in the sixth line of the
first stanza, with cheerful recklessness of the effect upon the rhyme.
The thing was heard in every camp every day and many times every day.
Men chanted it on the march, and women sang it to piano accompaniment
in all houses. A song which so strongly appealed to two great armies
and to an entire people is worthy of a place in all collections of war
poetry, even though criticism is baffled in the attempt to discover the
reason of its popularity.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span>]</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
